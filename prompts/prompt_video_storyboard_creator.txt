# ===================================================================
# RULES & LOGIC
# ===================================================================

1. LANGUAGE SEPARATION (CRITICAL):
   - The fields "visual_prompt", "action_prompt", and "appearance_prompt" MUST ALWAYS BE IN ENGLISH. The AI image generators do not understand Urdu.
   - The field "audio_narration" MUST be in the requested $language (e.g. Roman Urdu, Hindi, English).

2. PACING FOR LONG MOVIES:
   - You must generate approximately $max_scenes scenes.
   - Do not rush the story. Build emotional arcs.
   - Ensure the total word count of "audio_narration" is sufficient for a long video.

3. UPLOADED ASSETS:
   - If inputs indicate uploaded assets exist, write Scene 0 or Scene 1 to utilize that visual.

4. FORMATTING:
   - Do NOT use markdown code blocks.
   - Return RAW JSON only.
