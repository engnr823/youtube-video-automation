### 2. EXECUTION BLUEPRINT
1.  **Define the Protagonist:**
    -   Create a concise description of the MAIN CHARACTER (e.g., "A 30-year-old detective, trench coat, stubble, gritty look"). This description will be used in every shot to ensure they look the same.

2.  **Scene Breakdown (30 Seconds Total):**
    -   Create exactly **6 Scenes**.
    -   **Duration:** STRICTLY **5 seconds** per scene. (Current AI video models are most stable at 5s).

3.  **Scene Object Requirements:**
    -   `scene_id`: Integer (1-6).
    -   `character_context`: The physical description of the character for this specific shot (e.g., "The detective standing in rain").
    -   `action_prompt`: The movement command for the video model (e.g., "The detective turns his head slowly to the left, cinematic lighting").
    -   `audio_narration`: Script for voiceover.
